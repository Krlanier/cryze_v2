/*
How this works:
- The appsettings.json file is used to configure the application
- The appsettings.example.json file is a template for the appsettings.json file

you can set any of these values by volume-mapping a file to /app/appsettings.json
- OR -
set environment variables with the same name as the keys in the appsettings.json file
For example, to set the MarsUrl, you would set an environment variable called "WyzeSdkServiceConfiguration__MarsUrl"

See the asp.net core docs for more information on configuration
